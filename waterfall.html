<h2>A GOOD WALK IN THE BUSH</h2>

<h3>Getting to the falls</h3>

<p>
The falls are on the Goodradigbee river in NSW Australia in the "Bimberi Wilderness Area". 
These infrequently visited falls can only be reached by a fairly tough walk from Mt Ginini.
Mt Ginini is accessible from Canberra ACT via Brindabella road and Mt Franklin road.
The Mt Franklin road is sometimes closed at various points (snow or bush fires). 
</p>
<p> 
The starting point is at the Mt Ginini Air Navigation and Meteorological facility.
This is automated and unattended, and you can park outside the perimeter fence.
The track start (Harry's Spur trail) can be seen heading South from here.  
</p>
<p>
Total distance to the falls is a bit more than 7km.
The elevation difference is 840m.
The return walk will take all day, so start early!
</p>
<p>
The first 400m is easy going.
After that, as at 2020, the trail has been deliberately covered by logs and branches.
The logs are all transversely placed across the trail and are a great hindrance to walking.
However the trail is consequently easy enough to follow (but one odd dead end branch to keep you alert).   
This is presumably to stop erosion but allow future bulldozer access to temporarily re-open the trail for bushfire purposes.
After about 5km, you have to leave the trail and "bush bash" West on a ridge down to the river (nearly 2km).
This walk will be slow going because of thick bush the whole way (but thankfully not much thorny stuff). 
You might want to think about protecting your eyes and hands for this part of the walk.  
</p> 
<p>
At the falls itself, there are good spots for viewing and lunch at the top, or at the bottom.
But it is not as easy as you would imagine, to get from the top rocks round to the bottom pool.  
</p> 
<p>
Here are some critical waypoints going down:<br>
1. Mt Ginini Tower: (-35.5296, 148.7724)<br>
2. Fork right: (-35.5354, 148.7634)<br>
3. Bush bash West: (-35.5539, 148.7423)<br>
4. The falls: (-35.5548, 148.7239)
