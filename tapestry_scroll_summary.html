<h1>VIMALAKIRTI AND HEAVENLY MAIDEN - HAND SILK TAPESTRY</h1>

<h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>

<div>

<p>
This is an exquisite silk hand scroll tapestry (approx 28cm W, 52cm H) with colophon and seals.
</p>

<p>
Owned by Csilla Laczko [csilla2611@gmail.com].
It was a gift in 1968 from her then mother in law in Singapore, of Manchurian heritage.
Currently held in safe storage at "Endangered Heritage", Phillip ACT.
Their contact is Victoria Pearce 
<a href="http://endangeredheritage.com/our-team">[http://endangeredheritage.com/our-team]</a>.
An associate of Victoria is including this tapestry as part of an academic research project. 
<p>

<p>
The image on the tapestry depicts an important episode in the Buddhist Vimalakirti Nirdesa Sutra.
It is dated 1762, year of the water horse, during the Manchurian emperor Qianlong dynasty.
The ancient Chinese "cursive" text is a related poem, attributed to the emperor himself.
The many red seal images are woven into the tapestry (not stamped) and include imperial
seals of the emperor, and possibly Tibetan imperial seals are represented.
</p>

<p>
It has been assessed (ref CL080715) by Bridget Pearl supervised by Victoria Pearce on 17 June 2016.
</p>

<p>
For its age the textile elements of the object is in excellent condition, the delicate floss like fibres
are still lustrous under a microscope and very little dirt is found within the fibre.
The colours are still vibrant, with very little evidence of fading.

<h2>2. THE SILK WEAVING</h2>

<div>

<p>
Done in a technique called Kesi or K'o-ssu.
This technique is difficult (and errors can be unrecoverable) but allows fine colored detail to be woven in to the silk.
It is manually intensive, needing a simple loom with many bobbins in use, and may have taken a year to produce.
Kesi uses many fine, dense packed, weft threads which each cover only part of the warp and results in a mirror image on the reverse. 
In this piece, the warp is vertical as viewed normally, and appears to have an amazingly high density:
44 warp threads per centimeter, 32 weft threads per centimeter.
</p>

<p>
Kesi was included on the World Intangible Cultural Heritage list in 2009.
</p>

<p>
Imperial patronage for kesi reached a new height in the 18th century. 
Some scrolls are recorded in the third edition of the Shi qu bao ji (Catalogue of Painting and Calligraphy in the Imperial Collection), 1794.
The Qianlong emperor selected a number of important calligraphic masterpieces from his collection to be 'reproduced' in kesi.
</p>

<p>
Colours used (hand spun hand dyed silk) include:
<ul>
<li>Royal red (insignias and Stamps)</li> 
<li>Light green ( flower foliage/leaves)</li> 
<li>Light pink (head dress and checks)</li> 
<li>Hot pink (woman's robe)</li> 
<li>Dark blue( robes of  figures)</li>  
<li>Yellow ( flowers, cloth, shoes)</li>
<li>Porcelain skin tone (figures)</li> 
<li>Dark brown (wooden screen)</li>
<li>Orange (scroll and carpet)</li>
<li>Light blue (scroll and carpet)</li> 
<li>Ebony black (characters and detailing)</li>
<li>China white (robes and warp threads)</li>
</ul>

<p>
There is no "cheating" by using painting over the weave. 
</p>

</div>

<h2>3. THE TEXT (MAINLY THE POEM)</h2> 

<div>

<p>
The text is in an old calligraphic style and was transliterated by Straker Translations into traditional Chinese.

The translator was a Canada native who studied in Taipei and specializes in art/literary translations:

<p>
A google search found the entire poem in 
<a href="http://ctext.org/wiki.pl?if=gb&chapter=605345&remap=gb#">[http://ctext.org/wiki.pl?if=gb&chapter=605345&remap=gb#]</a>
The last part of the URL above, following the #, is the title of the poem.
The text is at 
<a href="http://ctext.org/library.pl?if=gb&file=71067&page=127&remap=gb">[http://ctext.org/library.pl?if=gb&file=71067&page=127&remap=gb]</a>
This literary heritage site requests a link to their main page at 
<a href="http://ctext.org/zhs">[http://ctext.org/zhs]</a> 
in English as <a href="http://ctext.org/ens">[http://ctext.org/ens]</a>
</p>

<p>
Although that site has the poem seemingly categorized in the wiki as "First Emperor Wen collection -> Volumes 7 to 30",
the site 
<a href="http://www.jianbihua360.com/huihua/14604.html">[http://www.jianbihua360.com/huihua/14604.html]</a> 
says that the main writings of emperor Qianlong on Buddhism include a work with this title.
</p>

<p>
The full text is also found at 
<a href="https://www.kanripo.org/text/KR4f0004/030">[https://www.kanripo.org/text/KR4f0004/030]</a>
This is from Kanseki repository, Individual collections Qing, 
Anthologies (Poetry and Collected Writings), imperial anthology - Qing, Gao Hong Li
(n.b. Gao = emperor, Hongli is birth name of Qianlong). 
</p>

<p>
Over 40,000 poems and 1,300 prose texts have authorship attributed to emperor Qianlong.
Qianlong strongly identified with the image subject - to the extent of having a picture of himself painted as Vimalakirti.  
</p>

<p>
At the end of the text we have the date, and presumably the name of the artist of the original scroll image.
This name is "Shu Chan" or "Suchan" or "Shuzan" but this could be a name, "style name", or nickname.
</p>

<p>
The poem would require a poet with deep knowledge of Chinese Buddhist tradition to properly translate,
but it refers to Vimalakirti living as lay person, yet being fully enlightened, and able to demonstrate
the nature of "entering the Dharma-Door of Nonduality" in learned debate by maintaining a "thunderous silence".
</p>

<p>
The emperor's ten volumes of collected Chinese-language poems reveal he returned to the subject of the goddess' "rain of owers" many times over,
as in 1754, when he wrote a poem titled "Hall of Raining Flowers" ("Yuhuashi"). In it he reiterated his desire to "manifest emptiness,"
just as Vimalakrti had done.
</p>

<h2>4. THE SEALS</h2>

<div>

<p>
There are 12 red seals depicted on the tapestry, woven in, rather than stamped.
More searching is needed to  identify them all.
At least some of these are official Qianlong seals.
One may be an imperial Tibetan seal.
The emperor had about 1800 seals made in his lifetime.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.sothebys.com/en/news-video/auction-essays/inscriptions-n09337/2015/02/the-qianlong-emperor.html">
[http://www.sothebys.com/en/news-video/auction-essays/inscriptions-n09337/2015/02/the-qianlong-emperor.html]</a> 
contains a portait of the emperor Qianlong with a seal matching one on our tapestry.
</p>

</div>

<h2>5. THE IMAGE AND ITS HERITAGE</h2>

<div>

<p>
What is portrayed is a part of the Vimalkirti sutra where Vimalkirti has finished the debate on Nonduality
by his famous silence, and a "heavenly maiden" has appeared. The heavenly maiden had been invisible,
"a certain goddess who lived in the house 12 years", and scatters blossoms which do not adhere to the bodies of the enlightened.
Vimalakirti, with haloed head is seated on a couch, with the goddess Tiannvsanhua behind him with flowers (blossoms scattering).
Tiannvsanhua is (appropriately) giving the right hand Buddhist "Vitarka" gesture implying teaching/debate.
A dated poem is at the top of the scroll, with red seals near it and near the borders of the silk.  
</p>

<p>
The woven image is a likely a special copy of a painting, which no longer exists.
Copying is a rich and respected tradition in China.
The internet contains some Chinese art images which are almost identical (including the text and seals) to this image.
There is also an image which is a mirror image.
And some images which are identical except for the positioning of the text.
These similar images are physically distinct and of different sizes.
</p>

<p>
There also exist some images which differ in small particular ways:
a different couch for Vimalakirti (style is clue to dynasty);
amount of detail in the couch/platform;
a halo or not around Vimalakirti's head (halo was a later adoption);
a different fan in Vimalakirti's hand, or a slight hand gesture;
goddess on the left instead of right.
</p>

<p>
There is a pictorial lineage of Vimalakirti images going back to the Mogoa Caves
near Dunhuang on silk road from Lhasa to Mongolia.
</p>

<p>
As mentioned in the introduction, similar, and related artwork images exist on the web at the given links.
There is no evidence of any other identical Kesi though.
</p>

</p>

</div>

<h2>6. CULTURAL RESONANCES</h2>

<div>

<p>
The fact that the lay Vimalakirti could attain perfect enlightenment while carrying on a normal
life rather than the life of an ascetic monk appealed to many.
</p>

<p>
Over time, the "Heavenly Maiden" came to be regarded as the only 
and necessary partner of Vimalakirti. In fact, the Heavenly Maiden even 
became a model of a cultivated lady who can understand her man very 
well. In consequence, the Heavenly Maiden accompanying Vimalakirti 
becomes a symbol for a well-established couple and is thus a good 
example to follow, and appreciated by the Chinese literati.
</p>

<p>
The Zen buddhist nature of the sutra was popular in China.
</p>

<p>
The way the Heavenly maiden, after the flower scattering, was to swap bodily form
with the reverend Sariputra, in a debate about the nature of identity including or excluding gender,
is a very early religious statement about gender equality.
</p>

<p>
Today, the discussion and identity reversals resonate with the idea of quantum superposition in physics.
</p>

<p>
The kesi weaving technique reminds us of high resolution screen pixels, but with added tricks to gain
better viewing using a range of different weft packing styles.
